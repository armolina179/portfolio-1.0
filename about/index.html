                    <h2 class="about-heading">Design Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>I design with an ecological mindset, thinking about how technology, people, and the planet shape one another. For me, every interface is part of a bigger picture. I aim to help brands build digital experiences that feel intentional and interconnected, allowing design, message, and meaning to work together as a system.</p>
                    <p>
                        In practice, this means working across UX/UI design, brand strategy, and interaction design to create digital products and experiences that reflect these values. Projects like <a href="/works" class="work-preview-link" data-preview="../projects/momentportal/portal.gif" data-preview-type="image">Moment / Portal</a> and the <a href="/works" class="work-preview-link" data-preview="../projects/digitalmetabolism/metabolisms.mp4" data-preview-type="video">Digital Metabolism Test</a> grew from this approach, inviting users to reflect on their relationship to time, technology, and consumption in the digital age.</p>

                    <h2 class="about-heading">Professional Experience</h2>
                    <p>Working with Starbucks and the Tryer Innovation Lab gave me hands-on experience designing for both people and scale. I learned how human-centered design principles guide innovation by <span style="color: blue">improving in-store workflows</span> and <span style="color: blue">shaping digital tools</span> for partners and customers alike. These roles strengthened my skills in <span style="color: blue">problem-solving</span>, <span style="color: blue">cross-team collaboration</span>, and <span style="color: blue">translating complex challenges</span> into design opportunities.</p>
                    <p>This work reinforced my belief that good design begins with listening: to users, to teams, and to the environments we create together.</p>

                    <h2 class="about-heading">Current Projects and Career Direction</h2>
                    <p>As I complete my B.A. in Media Arts and Sciences at Arizona State University, I'm expanding my technical foundation through the Google UX Design Certificate and exploring tools like React, Python, and AI-driven design systems. My current projects blend creative storytelling, interactive media, and sustainable digital practice, building toward work that bridges creativity and technology.</p>
                    <p>I'm seeking opportunities to join collaborative teams where I can design purposeful digital experiences. My goal is to help make our shared digital ecosystems more humane, intentional, and generative. If you're interested in working together, please <a href="/contact">reach out</a>!</p>
